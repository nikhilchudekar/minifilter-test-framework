# minifilter-test-framework
This project aims at providing a framework using which unit test-cases can be built for file-system mini-filter drivers. The idea is to employ TDD (test-driven development) during the development of kernel mode drivers.

The framework has been written in C++ with additional dependency on boost libraries. I admit, this dependecny is bit of a overkill (I only make use of couple of features from boost) but intention is to get hands-on with the librabry. It can be off course replaced quite easily - feel free to fork the repo and customise with other alternatives as you see fit.
